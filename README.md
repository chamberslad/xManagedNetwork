## What‚Äôs In This Document üî∞
This document is intended  to explain custom Terraform Module for using Managed Network purpose. It will deploy fully configured and ready to use compliance virtual network for any purpose of using it. 

You can create a virtual network with this module. Also you can manage these resources;

‚òëÔ∏è  Ability to control and managing DNS Settings on the Virtual Network <br>
‚òëÔ∏è  Ability to control and managing creating Subnet(s) on the Virtual Network <br>
‚òëÔ∏è Ability to control creating NSG(s) per subnet-level on the Virtual Network <br>
‚òëÔ∏è Ability to control creating Routes in UDR(s) for aligning Transit Network Service and Internet Access Service <br>
‚òëÔ∏è  Ability to control and configuring DDoS protection attachment on the Virtual Network <br>
‚òëÔ∏è  Ability to control and configuring Network Flow Log(s) and Traffic Analytics on the Network Resources <br>
üö©  Ability to control and configuring Diagnostics Logging Profile for Managed Network Resources to Storage Account <br>
üö©  Ability to control and configuring Diagnostics Logging Profile for Managed Network Resources to Event Hub <br>
üö©  Ability to control and configuring Diagnostics Logging Profile for Managed Network Resources to Log Analytics <br>

Reference the module to a specific version (recommended):
```hcl

module "xManagedNetwork" {
  source = "github.com/hasangural/managed-network"
  #version = "0.0.1"
  SubscriptionId       = var.SubscriptionId
  TenantId             = var.TenantId
  ClientId             = var.ClientId
  SecretKey            = var.SecretKey

  ServiceId             = var.ServiceId
  EnvironmentInstanceId = var.EnvironmentInstanceId
  InstanceId            = var.InstanceId

  Region               = var.Region
  vNetworkSettings     = var.vNetworkSettings
  vSubnetsSettings     = var.vSubnetsSettings
  MonitoringSettings   = var.MonitoringSettings
}
```
