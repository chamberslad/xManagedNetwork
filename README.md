| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

We need to start by cloning the xManagedNetwork repository. It contains all the bash scripts and cluster definiation which we needed to set up a cluster.|

Reference the module to a specific version (recommended):
```hcl

module "xManagedNetwork" {
  source = "github.com/hasangural/xManagedNetwork"
  #version = "0.0.1"
  SubscriptionId       = var.SubscriptionId
  TenantId             = var.TenantId
  ClientId             = var.ClientId
  SecretKey            = var.SecretKey

  ServiceId             = var.ServiceId
  EnvironmentInstanceId = var.EnvironmentInstanceId
  InstanceId            = var.InstanceId

  Region               = var.Region
  vNetworkSettings     = var.vNetworkSettings
  vSubnetsSettings     = var.vSubnetsSettings
  MonitoringSettings   = var.MonitoringSettings
}
```
