## Get up and running in a minute üöÄ 
We need to start by cloning the xManagedNetwork repository. It contains all the terraform files which needed to set up a new managed virtual network.

1. **Clone the xManaged Network Repository - example branch.**

   ```bash
   git clone -b example https://github.com/hasangural/xManagedNetwork.git

   or 

   ```
2. **Initialize Terraform**

   Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
  <details>
  <summary>Click to expand - see output of script</summary>

  ```bash
  # You should see example of output as below-stated.
    "‚ùØ terraform init"

    "Initializing modules..."
    "- xBastion in modules\xBastion"
    "- xMonitoring in modules\xMonitoring"
    "- xNetwork in modules\xNetwork"
    "- xRouteTable in modules\xRouteTable"
    "- xSecurityGroup in modules\xSecurityGroup"

    "Initializing the backend..."

    "Initializing provider plugins..."
    "- Checking for available provider plugins..."
    "- Downloading plugin for provider 'azurerm' (hashicorp/azurerm) 2.15.0..."

    "Terraform has been successfully initialized!"

    "You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running 'terraform plan' to see"  
    "any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands"
    "should now work."

    "If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,"      
    "rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other"
    "commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary."
      ```
